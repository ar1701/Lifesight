# LifeSight BI - Recent Improvements

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Gemini AI Overload Issue ✅

**Problem**: Gemini API was frequently returning "AI model is currently overloaded" errors when generating charts and tables.

**Solutions Implemented**:

- **Model Change**: Switched from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-1.5-flash` (more stable and less overloaded)
- **Content Limiting**: Limited file content to first 2000 characters to prevent API overload
- **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Implemented smart retry with longer delays for quota issues (5s, 15s, 30s)
- **Rate Limiting**: Added middleware to limit users to 2 requests per minute to prevent quota exhaustion
- **Fallback System**: Created automatic fallback chart/table generation when AI quota is exceeded
- **Better Error Handling**: Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios (overload, quota, JSON parsing)
- **Frontend Error Fix**: Fixed JavaScript error in table generation that was causing "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- **Widget Saving Fix**: Fixed widget saving to dashboard by updating model and controller to handle both chart and table widgets
- **Delete Functionality**: Added delete functionality for uploaded files and dashboard widgets with confirmation dialogs
- **Optimized Prompts**: Streamlined prompts to be more concise and focused

### 2. UI/UX Redesign ✅

**Problem**: Login and register pages had outdated, poor-looking UI.

**Solutions Implemented**:

- **Modern Glass Morphism Design**: Implemented frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds with animated floating shapes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper responsive breakpoints
- **Enhanced Form Controls**: Modern input styling with smooth transitions and focus states
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, button animations, and visual feedback
- **Password Validation**: Real-time password confirmation validation on register page
- **Consistent Branding**: Unified design language across both pages

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in your `.env` file:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lifesight
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
PORT=3000
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test chart/table generation with various file sizes
2. Verify retry logic works under API overload conditions
3. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
4. Validate form submissions and error handling
5. Check password confirmation validation
